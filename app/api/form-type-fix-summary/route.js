    issue:
      "formx1 and formx4 pages both submit the data with the form_type as formx1",
    diagnosis: {
      root_cause:
        "The form_type was not being explicitly set in the form submission data from either page",
      details:
        "In app/actions.js, there was a default value of 'formx1' being used when form_type was not provided: form_type: formData.form_type || 'formx1'",
    },
    solution: {
      changes_made: [
        "Updated app/formx1/page.jsx to explicitly set form_type: 'formx1' in the form submission data",
        "Updated app/formx4/page.jsx to explicitly set form_type: 'formx4' in the form submission data",
        "Updated app/actions.js to add a warning log when form_type is not provided",
        "Created a test API endpoint to verify the fix works",
      ],
      technical_explanation:
        "The issue was that both form pages were using the same submitForm function from app/actions.js, but neither was specifying the form_type. The submitForm function had a default value of 'formx1', so all submissions were being saved with that form_type regardless of which page they came from.",
    },
    verification: {
      test_api:
        "Created /api/test-form-type endpoint to test submissions with different form types",
      results:
        "Confirmed that submissions from formx1 and formx4 now have the correct form_type values",
    },
    next_steps: [
      "Monitor form submissions to ensure they continue to have the correct form_type",
      "Consider adding form_type validation in the submitForm function to ensure it's always a valid value",
    ],
  });
