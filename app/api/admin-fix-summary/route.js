    issue:
      "Admin page not showing data and all forms showing the same form_type",
    diagnosis: {
      root_cause:
        "The admin page was using the anon key to access the database, but the data was only accessible with the service key",
      details:
        "The direct-test API showed that when using the anon key, no submissions were returned, but when using the service key, 10 submissions with 2 different form types were found",
      browser_limitation:
        "The service key (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) is not accessible in the browser because it doesn't have the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix, which is a security feature",
    },
    solution: {
      changes_made: [
        "Created server-side API endpoints to fetch forms and submissions using the service key",
        "Updated the admin page to use these API endpoints instead of direct Supabase access",
        "Created diagnostic APIs to help troubleshoot the issue",
      ],
      technical_explanation:
        "In Supabase, Row Level Security (RLS) policies control what data is accessible with different keys. The anon key is subject to RLS policies, while the service key bypasses them. Since the service key can't be used directly in the browser, we created server-side API endpoints that use the service key and expose the data to the client.",
    },
    next_steps: [
      "If you want to use the anon key directly in the browser, you need to create appropriate RLS policies in Supabase",
      "Otherwise, continue using the server-side API endpoints for admin functions",
    ],
    security_note:
      "This approach is more secure than exposing the service key to the browser, as it keeps sensitive credentials on the server side.",
  });
