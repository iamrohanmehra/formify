    issue: "Inaccurate submission stats displayed on the admin page",
    diagnosis: {
      root_cause:
        "The submission count in the forms table was calculated based on the current submissions array, which only contained submissions for the currently selected form.",
      details: [
        "The admin page was not correctly tracking submission counts for each form type.",
        "The getSubmissionValue function had issues with handling form_data and legacy fields.",
        "There was no dedicated API endpoint for fetching detailed stats.",
      ],
    },
    solution: {
      changes_made: [
        "Updated the admin page to use a dedicated submissionCounts state variable to track counts for each form type.",
        "Modified the forms API endpoint to include submission counts for each form type.",
        "Improved the getSubmissionValue function to better handle form_data and legacy fields.",
        "Enhanced the submissions API endpoint to better process form_data and legacy fields.",
        "Created a new stats API endpoint to provide detailed statistics.",
        "Added a new Stats tab to the admin page to display comprehensive statistics.",
      ],
      technical_explanation:
        "The issue was that the admin page was calculating submission counts based on the currently loaded submissions, which only included submissions for the selected form. We fixed this by tracking submission counts separately for each form type and updating the counts whenever submissions are fetched. We also improved the handling of form_data and legacy fields to ensure all submission data is correctly displayed.",

      expected_results: [
        "The forms table now shows accurate submission counts for each form type.",
        "The submissions table correctly displays all form fields, including those in form_data.",
        "The new Stats tab provides comprehensive statistics about submissions.",
      ],
    },
    next_steps: [
      "Monitor the admin page to ensure stats remain accurate as new submissions are added.",
      "Consider adding more detailed statistics or filtering options in the future.",
    ],
